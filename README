BioSD-modular
=============


This is a repository for easy compilation of the BioSD web-app.

Ant
---

You must provide a file named "build.properties" that specifies the location of the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). 

For example ::

  gwt.dir=/home/root/gwt-2.4.0/

Once that is present, it can be compiled by using the command "ant".

Maven
-----

Maven support is partial.
